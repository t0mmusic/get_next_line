# get_next_line
Creates a string containing the next line of a file

# Purpose
This project will return a string containing a single line of text read referenced by a file descriptor. The amount of text is limited by a variable buffer, and the output must be the same regardless of buffer size.
Any data left over by the buffer after a line has been found must be stored using a static variable.
# Bonus
The project must now work with multiple file descriptors. Only one static variable may be used.
